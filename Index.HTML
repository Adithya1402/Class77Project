    The console. log() is a function that writes a message to log on the debugging console, such as Webkit or Firebug. In a browser you will not see anything on the screen. It logs a message to a debugging console. It is only available in Firefox with Firebug and in Webkit based browsers (Chrome and Safari)

    var last_name="S Nath"
    console.log(first_name.concat(last_name));

    var a =10;
    var b =5;

    var add= a+b;
    console.log(add);

    var subtract = a - b;
    console.log(subtract);

    var multiply = a * b;
    console.log(multiply);

    var divide = a / b;
